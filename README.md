ACEToolKit
==========
This toolkit is a collection of classes and categories that I'm using in many of my projects.

#### Classes
- ACEActionSheet (UIActionSheet with blocks)
- ACEAlertView (UIAlertView with blocks)

#### Categories
- UIColor (some macros and HEX string parser)
- UILabel (resize the label to contain the text)
- UIView (many shortcuts to get position, dimensions, round corners and other properties)

Usage
-----
Import the main header file in the prefix header for all source files (*.pch)

``` objective-c
 #import "ACEToolKit.h" 
```
